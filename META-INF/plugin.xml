  <name>Pull up method refactoring extension</name>
  <description><![CDATA[
     <p> Extends <i>Pull Members Up</i> refactoring to consider methods with different types in different classes to be pulled-up as an abstract method with generic types.</p> <p> Also provides an extension of the <i>Extract Superclass</i> refactoring to support several classes simulteanously.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p> <ul>
            <li><b>0.2</b> Introduce new type parameters only if needed.</li>
            <li><b>0.1</b> First release, with <ul>
                <li>pull-up method with generics and </li><li> extract superclass for several classes (automatically selects classes with methods that has been specified). </li></ul></li>
            </ul>    </p>
            <p> Known bugs (pull up):
                 <ul>
                    <li> Fails when incoherent type parameters between a class and its superclass.</li>
                    <li> Fails when several abstract classes in the considered hierarchy. </li>
                    <li> Fails with polymorphic methods (with type parameters attached to the methods). </li>
                    <li> Fails when conflicting method visibilities.</li>
                    <li> Fails when the method to pull up is already abstract in one of the considered classes.</li>
                    <li> Fails when the method to pull up is already in the superclass.</li>
                    <li> Fails when several overloaded methods are pulled up (a same type parameter can be introduced twice). </li>
